# Classification-assignment-using-Nearest-Neighbors-on-the-diabetes-dataset
OVERVIEW:

This project involved analysing a diabetes dataset and how different factors make you more prone to being diagnosed to it.

The main focus was to see what factors make one more likely to get diabates.

Python was used to clean, analyse and visualze the given dataset. Getting Started:

Installation:

Setting up the Diabetes database is the first step. Link to dataset - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

Having access to google colab or visual studio code is needed to analyse the data.

Using Python to clean, analyse and visualze the data:

Using the right Python functions and libraries to clean the data is essential so that the data can be properly analysed.

Heatmaps were used to see the different correlations and make judgements on which factor contributes to getting diabetes more.
ROC curves and scatterplots were also used to analyse our data.
